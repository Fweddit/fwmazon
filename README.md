Fwmazon is the new tool developped by the IT Bureau of J4LP, a famous alliance from the MMORPG Eve-Online.
Its goal is to provide a unified web interface for ordering doctrine ships and special modules, while also improving our efficiency in Special Operations.


To get started:
* Clone the repository
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Modify the afwmazon/settings.py
* ./manage.py migrate --all
* And some more stuff not included yet (Eve dbs for example, will put it in fixtures later)
